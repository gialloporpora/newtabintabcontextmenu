This is the source of the New-Tab-In-Tab-Context-Menu add-on. It is not a great add-on, but you can learn how to add simple menuitems to Firefox's menu.

==Installing addon-sdk==
First of all, you need to install the *addon-sdk*. Simply download it and extract where you like, I have installed it in **d:\addon-sd**.

Activate the addon--sdk, from commandline:

```
cd addon-sdk\bin
activate.bat
```

Build it with this command:


```
cfx xpi
```

To test use:

```
cfx run
```

For documentation about the addon-sdk use:
